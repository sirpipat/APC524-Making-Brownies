Reference: https://www.instructables.com/id/Brownies-for-Beginners/

Step 1: Gathering Ingredients
1/2 Cup of Vegetable Oil or 1 stick of butter
1 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon of baking powder
1/3 cup of cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/2 cup of flour

Step 2: Preheat the Oven to 350 Degrees Fahrenheit or 175 Degrees Celsius

Step 3: Heat the Butter Until Liquid If You're Using Butter. Otherwise, Blend the Oil/butter and Sugar Together.
Butter seems to be better for this recipe but you don't have butter, oil works just fine.

Step 4: Add in the Eggs and Vanilla and Mix Until Blended

Step 5: Add All the Dry Ingredients (cocoa, Flour, Baking Powder) Into a Bowl and Mix.
Make sure they are dry.
